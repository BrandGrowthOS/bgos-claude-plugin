# Changelog

Notable changes to the HOAI Claude Code plugin.

## 0.31.0 — 27 July 2026

The first release since 0.21.1. Twenty-two commits, and the reason it is being
cut now is that the app already requires it: HOAI raised its Claude Code
staleness floor to 0.31.0, so until this is tagged and published every user was
told their plugin was out of date and could never clear it.

### Heartbeat

- **The daemon reports its working directory** (0.31.0). This is what lets the
  app show which folder an agent is actually running from, and is the reason
  the app's floor was raised to this version.
- **Version heartbeat**: pairing daemons report `daemonVersion` (0.22.0), which
  is what makes staleness detectable at all.

### Voice

- **Per-agent realtime model**, applied from the mint frame (0.30.0).

### Tools available to agents

- **`show_component`**, the generic renderable-components tool (0.26.0).
- **`show_health_tracker`**, summoning the native tracker card (0.25.0), later
  extended to carry the rich Budget board payload (0.28.0).
- **Native health-log tools**: `log_health_event`, `list_health_events`,
  `undo_health_event` (0.23.0).
- **`complete_mission`** takes an optional honest summary.
- **Outbound file types** match the backend allowlist (0.29.0).

### Self-update

- **Opt-in self-update** with a shared-checkout lock, a stable wrapper and a
  rollback latch, then **defaulted ON** (0.27.0).

### Fixes

- **Per-agent credential resolution is isolated**, so one agent's credentials
  cannot resolve for another.
- **BGOS slash commands execute** rather than being echoed.
- **Restart replay bug**: per-chat poll cursors persist and a first-run backlog
  gate stops a restarted daemon re-answering messages it already handled.
- **Scheduling**: a recurrence or `everyHours` object serialized to a JSON
  string in `when` is recovered rather than rejected.
- **Context**: stop advertising a dead `/compact` and infer unmarked 1M windows
  (0.22.1).
- **Real remote `/compact`** via supervisor tmux injection, plus positive
  self-session binding for `contextPct` (0.24.0).

### Performance

- **Delta polling and conditional GETs**, plus a scoped fast mode and a
  reconcile cadence, so a daemon stops refetching whole chat histories.

### Honest limits

- Agent-side resting self-report: usage-cap detection, `resetAt` parsing, and a
  deduped PATCH so a capped agent says so instead of going quiet.
