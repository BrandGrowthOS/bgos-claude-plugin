// it "Media playback: the long description textarea". Two of two gates in that

// never remembered, so the owner was asked again every time.

// Words in the agent's own description of an element that mark an action as
// sensitive. The description is the `element` argument every Playwright action
// tool carries ("Pay now button"), plus typed text for browser_type. Heuristic
// by design; the owner is asked, never silently blocked.
//
// TWO FAMILIES, because one of them is never covered by a trusted site.
// CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS is the family the owner types himself: passwords,
// passcodes, PINs, one time codes, OTP, 2FA, two factor, verification and
// security codes, CVV, card numbers. An action naming one of those is kind
// "credential", it asks every time, and Trust this site does not cover it and
// is not even offered on its gate (gateChoices). SENSITIVE_PATTERNS is
// everything else that deserves an ask on an untrusted site and that a
// deliberate Trust may cover. classifyToolCall tests CREDENTIAL first, which
// matters for the strings that match both families ("Send verification code"
// hits the send pattern and the credential one; "Delete saved passwords" hits
// the delete pattern and the credential one): those are credentials, and the
// safe direction is the narrower, never remembered gate.
//
// FORMS. Every noun matches its plural ("Change permissions", "Manage roles",
// "Payments", "Saved passwords", "Pending invites", "Verification codes") and
// every verb its -s and -ing forms ("Deletes the file", "Sending the invoice").
// Each form is spelled out between word boundaries, so no unrelated word rides
// along: payload, payroll, postal, poster, passport, wireless, sender,
// publisher and roleplay stay ordinary writes. This matters most on a
// pre-approved site, where a form the patterns miss runs with no prompt at
// all. Two kinds of form are left out on purpose, because they label a list or
// a state rather than an action the click performs, and a sensitive gate asks
// every time with only Allow once or Deny: past forms (the Sent folder,
// Deleted items, Shared with me, Published, Paid) and the -s forms of post,
// tweet and reply (the Posts, Tweets and Replies tabs of every social site and
// CMS). A word heuristic cannot tell homographs apart, so "Job posting",
// "Buying guide" and "Wiring diagram" ask too. Pinned in
// __tests__/policy.sensitive-forms.test.js.
