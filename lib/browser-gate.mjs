/**
 * THE DAEMON BROWSER HOST'S PERMISSION GATE.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A COPY OF THE DESKTOP'S GATE. The rules are (see
 * `browser-host-core/policy.js`, vendored byte-identical so the two hosts
 * cannot drift on what counts as a credential). The MACHINERY cannot be,
 * because the two hosts have different surfaces:
 *
 *   The desktop has a pane. Its gate opens as a STRIP with a 60 second
 *   countdown the owner is probably looking at, and only an unanswered strip
 *   PARKS to a card in the owner's chat.
 *
 *   This host has NO pane. Nobody is looking at this machine, which is the
 *   whole point of the feature. So there is no strip phase at all: a gate
 *   posts its card the moment it is raised, and the card is the only surface
 *   it will ever have.
 *
 * HOW THE ANSWER GETS BACK, and this is the part that did not exist until
 * now. `browser_gate_answer` is emitted to the owner's PERSON room and
 * deliberately never to an agent socket. This host joins only
 * `browser-host:<assistantId>`, so it cannot hear that event: it could post a
 * card and then wait out the entire park for a frame that can never arrive.
 * So it ASKS instead, polling `GET /api/v1/browser/gate/:gateId`, which
 * answers open, answered, expired or unknown for ONE gate the caller names,
 * scoped to the caller's account AND to the assistant its host serves.
 *
 * THE ACTION RUNS AT MOST ONCE. A gate that outlives its call is PARKED: the
 * call returns `gate_parked` with the gate id and the card stays live, and
 * `hoai_browser_wait_gate` re-attaches to the same gate. Both the original
 * call and every re-attach await ONE held continuation, so an owner who
 * allows a click gets one click, no matter how many waiters were queued on
 * it. That mirrors the desktop's `entry.done` for the same reason.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED EVERYWHERE. An unreachable backend, an expired card, a gate the
 * server has never heard of, a kind the card route cannot carry, a poll that
 * runs out of park: every one of them ends the gate DENIED and the action does
 * not run. The only path that runs the action is the server saying, in
 * writing, that the owner answered with an allowing choice.
 */

/**
 * The gate kinds a CARD can carry (backend browser-gate-card.ts

 * sentence rather than being posted and bouncing. Vision is off by default on
